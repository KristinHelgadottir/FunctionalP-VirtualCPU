# Virtual CPU optemized for stack operations.

### My virtual CPU has four registers, one flag, and a memory of 64 bytes. 
#### Instructions are all 8 bit. 
#### There are no instructions for direct memory access.

I implemented as many instructions as I could, but I have started to late on this assignment. 
The questions I have, cannot be answered in time and there is no help to get at this time.
It has taken me two hours to read the code, it is not insanely readable, there are many oneliners I have not seen before and do not know what meen. 

Working instructions:

NOP
ADD AB
MUL AB
DIV A B
ZERO
 
PUSH r 
POP r

MOV r o 
MOV o r 
MOV v r
