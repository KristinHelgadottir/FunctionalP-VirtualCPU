# Virtual CPU optemized for stack operations.

### My virtual CPU has four registers, one flag, and a memory of 64 bytes. 
#### Instructions are all 8 bit. 
#### There are no instructions for direct memory access.

I implemented as many instructions as I could. 

All the instructions work now, and I have implemented the tail recursive method, hardcoded.
Takes the factoreal of 5.
